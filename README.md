# Sip and Puff Switch

The Sip and Puff Switch is an assistive technology that enables a user to control a device by using their mouth to "sip"(inhale) or "puff"(exhale) on a straw, tube or ‘wand’. It is primarily used by people with limited or no limb movement. The Sip and Puff Switch can be connected directly to an assistive device with a 3.5 mm jack or to a computer or smartphone using a suitable switch interface.

The Sip and Puff Switch has two 3.5 mm mono outputs so it can control two devices. The sip threshold and puff threshold are adjustable. The switch is powered by two CR2032 lithium coin cell batteries.

## Getting Started

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components
The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/SPA_BOM_v1.0.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Sip and Puff switch.

### 2. Order the Custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
The Sip and Puff Switch uses a custom PCB to mount all of the electronic components. Refer to [MMC_PCB_Fabrication_Manual](/Documentation/MMC_PCB_Fabrication_Manual.pdf) for information on how to order a custom PCB. For convenience, the final generated Gerber files for several PCB manufacturers are listed below. If you want to use a different manufacturer, instructions for converting the original [Eagle Files](/Design_Files/PCB/Eagle_Files) are also included in the MMC PCB Fabrication Manual.

### 3. Print the 3D Printable components

Print the components for the enclosure and the mouthpiece mount: [3D Printing Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing/). Total print time for the enclosure components is approximately 4.5 hours and for the mouthpiece mount components is approximately 2.5 hours.  

### 4. Assemble the Switch and Mouthpiece Mount

Reference the assembly instructions for the [Sip and Puff Switch](/Documentation/SPA_Assembly_v1.0.pdf) and the assembly instructions for the [Mouthpiece Stand](/Documentation/SPA_MPStand_Assembly_v1.0.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
