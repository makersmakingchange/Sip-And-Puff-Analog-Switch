# Sip and Puff Switch

The Sip and Puff Switch is an assistive technology that enables a user to control a device by using their mouth to "sip"(inhale) or "puff"(exhale) on a straw, tube or ‘wand’. It is primarily used by people with limited or no limb movement. The Sip and Puff Switch can be connected directly to an assistive device with a 3.5 mm jack or to a computer or smartphone using a suitable switch interface.

The Sip and Puff Switch has two 3.5 mm mono outputs so it can control two devices. The sip threshold and puff threshold are adjustable. The switch is powered by two CR2032 lithium coin cell batteries.
